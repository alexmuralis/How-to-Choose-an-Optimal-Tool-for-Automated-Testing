<p><a href="https://andersenlab.com/blueprint/automation-testing-essentiality?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=github.com&amp;utm_campaign=nadeem">In the previous article</a>, we found out why automated testing was necessary for software development and how to determine which processes need to be automated and which need not. Now let's figure out how to choose the right tool for automated testing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to answer this question, as there are many factors to consider. Particularly, you need to know what tools are available on the market at the moment, and which of them best suit the requirements and budget of your project. Along with that, you need to understand who in your team knows how to work with the tool that you plan to purchase.</p>
<p>The success of any test automation depends on choosing the right tool. Choosing the right testing tool will help you increase project productivity and reduce project costs. On average, a suitable tool doubles the speed of the testing process and hence allows saving up to 50% of the budget.</p>
<h2>Types of testing tools</h2>
<p>There are several types of testing tools that a QA manager can consider when choosing the right ones:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Open source tools</strong> - these are programs, the source code of which is available in the public domain workplace for free use and modification. There are many open-source tools for almost every stage of testing, but they often get outplayed by commercial ones in terms of functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial tools</strong> are produced for sale or other commercial purposes. These tools usually offer more functionality and support.</li>
<li><strong>User tools</strong> are developed specifically to solve problems that can&rsquo;t be solved with ready-made programs.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Analysis of automation feasibility</h2>
<p>As explained in the previous article, not all features of an application can always be tested, and some can never be tested with an automated tool. App functionality may change frequently or be too complex. Before you start choosing an automation tool, you need to analyze your test cases and decide what should be automated and what should not.</p>
<p>When analyzing the feasibility of automation, the following factors should be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>technical feasibility and complexity of script automation;</li>
<li>application stability;</li>
<li>test data;</li>
<li>application size;</li>
<li>possibility of reusing automated scripts;</li>
<li>possibility of running tests in different environments.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The process of tool selection</h2>
<p>In order to select the most suitable testing tool, a QA manager needs to follow the tool selection process described below.</p>
<h3>Step 1: identification of the need for tools</h3>
<p>You need to accurately define your requirements for the testing tool, document these requirements, and then give them to the team and management for consideration.</p>
<p>For example, requirements for a tool can be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The tool must automatically generate test cases.</li>
<li>The tool must automatically run test cases.</li>
<li>The tool must generate test results in the correct format.</li>
<li>The tool must enable a QA engineer to choose which test cases will run with a given set of data.</li>
<li>The tool must be able to verify and evaluate the test results.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 2: evaluation of tools and their suppliers</h3>
<p>After determining the requirements for the tool, a QA manager should take the following actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analyze commercial and open source projects that are currently available on the market and meet the requirements.</li>
<li>Create a short list of tools.</li>
<li>Evaluate the suppliers that offer solutions from the short list (reputation, level of support, tool update frequency, etc.).</li>
<li>Use the selected tools during the test period and evaluate them in practice.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 3: evaluation of costs and benefits</h3>
<p>In order to make sure the testing tool is useful, the manager needs to compare the costs and benefits of implementing it. It may turn out that a tool doubles the speed of the testing process while costing over 50% more than the salaries of the manual testers who are currently performing these processes.</p>
<p>In this case, it is recommended to consider other tools, including custom ones. Also, a good decision is to re-evaluate the feasibility of automating this process.</p>
<h3>Step 4: final decision</h3>
<p>In order to make a final decision, a QA manager needs to have the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Full information about the tool, its merits, and flaws.</li>
<li>The balance between costs and benefits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even after a detailed study of the tool&rsquo;s description and information about its supplier, it is necessary to test the system first-hand. When making a decision, you need to take into account the opinion of the team specialists who will work with this tool.</p>
<p>The responsibility for making this decision is high since its impact on the project results can be both positive and negative.</p>
<p>If you are not sure you are ready to make such a decision or have simply failed to find the right tool, you can contact us. Andersen provides software test automation services for any type of product. Our <a href="https://andersenlab.com/qa-engineers?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=github.com&amp;utm_campaign=nadeem">QA Automation Testers</a> provide QA Audit services to identify drawbacks in software testing, including readiness to launch test automation.</p>
<p>After an Audit, we identify the automation test strategy and set up the automation testing process.</p>
<p>In fact, we have found that a blend of manual and automated testing is the best way to achieve full test coverage and deliver the highest quality product. We have set up automated testing in 120+ projects including FinTech, Travel, and Retail projects.</p>
